a- The blood Glucose fasting reference range is between 4.7-5.6 ; Therefore, you are required to write a python program which is prompting the user to enter the records of sugar diabetes test for 7 days, and write them to the text file. Make sure to keep each record on a separate line in the file. You should also include a screenshot of the code and the output.

3- The format of the output should be identical to the given one.
4- The screenshots should also show part of your desktop in addition to the code/output.
